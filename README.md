# MNU-elf-bot
A bot for MNU students who aren't willing to put an **EXTRA** effort to get their certificate. <br> You will have to put some though!

## What is the bot used for?
- Generate the latest timetable
- Provides you the necessary links for your college needs
- Notifications for class time
- Set deadlines for your assignment/exam and give reminders  

## How does it work?
- You will have to send the latest pdf file of the class schedule to the bot. **(non FEST students)**
- You will also have to tell the bot the subjects you are doing as given in the pdf file.
-  After the procedure it will generate you a table with the class timings for your given subjects.
-  There won't be any limit to how many subjects you can add or remove but cannot add or remove any subject after the 2nd week.

## Can i use your code to make my own?
- Yes you can, or you could also contribute to this project and build/improve the bot with me.

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS!
_by using my bot you agree to every terms and conditions mentioned below_
- I am not responsible if you miss class or mess up timings due to unupdated schedule list, so make sure you've updated the pdf given to the bot.
- This bot does not belong to MNU, so I cannot add certain features like login to moodle/self-service and retreive data due to security measures.
- This bot is open source, so anyone is free to do whatever they want with this bot. However, I won't be liable if you use a different bot and got into trouble.
  - You can check the bots username (unique) or send me a private message to make sure whether you are using my bot or not.
  - I will be creating a bot group for your queries as well, you are free to join.
- No datas are saved or stored, you can check the code, its open source.
- Don't solely depend on this bot, this bot is suppose to make things easy for you, not 100% lazy.
