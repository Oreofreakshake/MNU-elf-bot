# MNU-elf-bot
A bot for MNU students who aren't willing to put an **EXTRA** effort to get their certificate. <br> You will have to put some though!

## What is the bot used for?
- Generate the latest timetable.
- Provides you the necessary links for your college needs.
- Will send you notifications for your class time.
- Set deadlines for your assignment/exam and give reminders (in development)  

## How does the timetable feature work?
- You will have to send the latest class schedule to the support [group](https://t.me/MNUelf) so the bot is updated.
  - normally the class schedules are updated in MNU offical viber groups.
- You can add 4 subjects at most, however if the department has allowed you to do more than 4, this bot can support that as well, just let [me](https://t.me/MNUelf) know.

## Can i use your code to make my own?
- Yes you can, or you could also contribute to this project and build/improve the bot with me.

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS!
_by using my bot you agree to every terms and conditions mentioned below_
- I am not responsible if you miss your classes, please send the latest schedule from the official MNU viber groups [here](https://t.me/MNUelf) so I can update the bot.
- This bot does not belong to MNU, so I cannot add certain features like login to moodle/self-service and retreive data due to security measures.
- This bot is open source, so anyone is free to do whatever they want with this bot. However, I won't be liable if you use a different bot and got into trouble.
  - You can check the bots username (unique) or send me a private message to make sure whether you are using my bot or not.
  - Join the support [group](https://t.me/MNUelf) for your queries.
- Don't solely depend on this bot, this bot is suppose to make things easy for you, not 100% lazy.
